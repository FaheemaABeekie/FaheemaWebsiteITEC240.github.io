	<h3> About Us: </h3>
	<p> The <strong>purpose</strong> of this blog is to
	provide a platform dedicated to navigating life at the College of Science,
	Technology, and Applied Arts of Trinidad and Tobago (COSTAATT). Whether
	you're a new student applying to COSTAATT, registering for your first semester or
	a seasoned learner looking for guidance and assistance, this blog aims to do just
	that. </p>
	
	<p>Some of the <strong>features</strong> this page will have are; a link to a webpage with contact
	information of multiple students in different fields who are willing to assist new
	students with their courses and assignments ie tutoring, step by step instructions on
	how to register for courses, the process of paying registration and what is needed,
	details on how to navigate the e-classroom, and of course my personal advice and
	experience at COSTAATT etc. </p>
	
	<p>With this, our <strong>goals</strong> are to make college life, well life at COSTAATT much more
	understandable and easy to navigate because when we started, having a blog like this
	or someone to help us with these stuff would have been really helpful, but instead
	we had to struggle to figure them out. This website was created to create a welcoming
	community where students can find inspiration, motivation, and assistance in overcoming
	challenges they may encounter in school. </p>
